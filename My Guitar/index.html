                This is my guitar. Since I’ve owned it, it has travelled across the world with me. Whether helping me
                stave off boredom in a cheap hostel or making me a bit of extra travelling money in an open mic night,
                it has been a constant companion.
                I learned to play my first complicated finger picking pattern on this guitar.
                Everyone learns guitar differently. Some are able to make chord shapes right off the bat,
                some have a knack for rhythm and running through licks across the fretboard.
            <p>

                As a beginner, I found that playing a single string was a lot more satisfying than playing
                chords because it actually sounded like part of a song.
                It was easier to play on just a single string than to try and get three or four of my fingers to make a
                chord
                shape.
                I started to learn a bunch of single-string riffs from Nirvana to The Beatles. And then I discovered
                tabs.
            <p>
                The important thing to note is that everyone’s guitar learning path is different and even though I’ve
                been
                playing since high school,
                that doesn’t mean I’m a master. Learning guitar and getting to a place where your playing is
                satisfactory
                takes
                a long time, and it takes a lot of practice and a lot of patience.
                To be honest, I’m not that great at playing, but I’m comfortable enough to pick things up on the spot
                whether by
                ear or with tabs.
                But before me, it belonged to someone else.
